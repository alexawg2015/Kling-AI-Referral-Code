### First Month with Referral Code Bonus

When you apply the **Kling AI referral code 7BN9SPBYZVNT**, your first month economics change dramatically. These calculations include the 166 signup credits plus the 50% referral bonus:

| Plan | Total First Month Credits | First Month Cost | Cost per 100 Credits |
|------|--------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Standard + Referral | 1,156 | $6.99 | $0.60 |
| Pro + Referral | 4,666 | $25.99 | $0.56 |
| Premier + Referral | 13,166 | $64.99 | $0.49 |
| **Ultra + Referral** | **31,166** | **$127.99** | **$0.41** |

The Ultra plan with referral code achieves $0.41 per 100 credits—surpassing even the Ultra annual commitment rate of $0.46 per 100 credits. This represents a 205% savings compared to direct credit purchases at $1.25 per 100 credits.

### Monthly and Annual Plans (Standard Rates)

| Plan | Credits per Month | Price | Cost per 100 Credits |
|------|------------------|-------|---------------------|
| Standard Monthly | 660 | $6.99/mo | $1.06 |
| Standard Annual | 660 | $79.20/yr | $1.00 |
| Pro Monthly | 3,000 | $25.99/mo | $0.87 |

| Ultra Annual | 26,000 | $1,429.99/yr | $0.46 |

### Direct Credit Purchases (No Subscription)

Direct purchases remain the least economical option, suitable only for emergency top-ups after exhausting subscription credits:

| Credits | Price | Cost per 100 Credits |
|---------|-------|---------------------|
| 330 | $5 | $1.52 |
| 660 | $10 | $1.52 |
| 1,320 | $20 | $1.52 |
| 3,500 | $50 | $1.43 |
| 7,500 | $100 | $1.33 |
| 16,000 | $200 | $1.25 |
| 48,000 | $600 | $1.25 |
| 96,000 | $1,200 | $1.25 |

Even bulk purchases of 96,000 credits cost $1.25 per 100—three times more expensive than the Ultra monthly subscription and more than four times costlier than using the **Kling AI referral code** strategy.

## Why the Ultra Plan with Referral Code Wins

The mathematical advantage is clear: purchasing the Ultra monthly plan with **Kling AI referral code 7BN9SPBYZVNT** delivers 31,166 credits for $127.99 in your first month. To acquire the same number of credits through direct purchase would cost approximately $389 at the best bulk rate—a difference of $261.

This first-month strategy leverages Kling's new user incentives to create a pricing anomaly where a single monthly subscription temporarily outperforms even annual commitments. The 5,000-credit referral cap ensures maximum benefit at higher subscription tiers, making the Ultra plan the optimal choice for serious users.

**Key insight:** The referral bonus is a one-time benefit per account, making your initial plan selection critical. Choose the highest tier you can reasonably utilize to maximize the 5,000 bonus credit value.
